## 116. Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node

You are given a `perfect binary tree` where all leaves are on the same level, and every parent has two children. The binary tree has the following definition:

```c
struct Node {
  int val;
  Node *left;
  Node *right;
  Node *next;
}
```

Populate each next pointer to point to its next `right node`. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to `NULL`.

Initially, all next pointers are set to `NULL`.

 

### Example 1:


- Input: `root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]`
- Output: `[1,#,2,3,#,4,5,6,7,#]`
- Explanation: Given the above perfect binary tree `(Figure A)`, your function should populate each next pointer to point to its next right node, just like in `Figure B`. The serialized output is in level order as connected by the next pointers, with `#` signifying the end of each level.

### Example 2:

- Input: `root = []`
- Output: `[]`
 

### Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 212 - 1].`
`-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`
 

### Follow-up:

You may only use constant extra space.
The recursive approach is fine. You may assume implicit stack space does not count as extra space for this problem.

## Solution: 

```java

class Solution {
    public Node connect(Node root) {
        if (root == null) {
            return root;
        }
        
        Node leftMost = root;
        
        while (leftMost.left != null) {
            Node current = leftMost;
            
            while (current != null) {
                current.left.next = current.right;
                
                if (current.next != null) {
                    current.right.next = current.next.left;
                }
                
                current = current.next;
            }
            
            leftMost = leftMost.left;
        }
        
        return root;
    }
}
