## Overview

Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. Developed by Sun Microsystems (now part of Oracle Corporation), Java is used for building a wide range of applications, from mobile apps to large-scale enterprise systems.

## Key Features

- **Platform Independence**: Java's "write once, run anywhere" (WORA) capability allows code to be executed on any device that has the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed.
- **Object-Oriented**: Java is built around the concept of objects, which makes it easier to design and maintain complex software.
- **Robust and Secure**: Java provides strong memory management, exception handling, and security features to create reliable and secure applications.
- **Multithreaded**: Java supports multithreading, which allows concurrent execution of two or more threads to maximize CPU usage and improve application performance.
- **Rich API**: Java offers a comprehensive set of standard libraries for tasks such as networking, I/O operations, and data manipulation.

## Basic Concepts

- **Class and Object**: A class is a blueprint for creating objects, while an object is an instance of a class.
- **Inheritance**: Java supports inheritance, allowing one class to inherit fields and methods from another.
- **Polymorphism**: Java supports polymorphism, enabling objects to be treated as instances of their parent class rather than their actual class.
- **Encapsulation**: Encapsulation hides the internal state of an object and only exposes a controlled interface for interacting with it.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Install the JDK from the [Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) or use a distribution like OpenJDK.
- **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**: Optional but recommended. Popular choices include [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/), and [NetBeans](https://netbeans.apache.org/).

### Installation

1. **Download and Install JDK**: Follow the instructions provided by the JDK installer.
2. **Set Up Environment Variables**: Ensure that the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable is set and the `bin` directory of the JDK is added to the system `PATH`.
3. **Verify Installation**: Open a terminal or command prompt and run `java -version` and `javac -version` to check that Java is properly installed.

### Writing a Simple Java Program

1. **Create a File**: Create a file named `HelloWorld.java`.
2. **Write Code**:
    ```java
    public class HelloWorld {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            System.out.println("Hello, World!");
        }
    }
    ```
3. **Compile**: Run `javac HelloWorld.java` to compile the code.
4. **Run**: Execute the program with `java HelloWorld`.

### Common Commands

- `javac <file>.java`: Compiles a Java source file.
- `java <class>`: Runs a Java application.
- `javadoc <file>.java`: Generates API documentation from source code comments.
