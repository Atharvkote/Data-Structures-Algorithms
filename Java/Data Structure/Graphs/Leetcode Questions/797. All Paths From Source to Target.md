# 797. All Paths From Source to Target

## Description

Given a directed acyclic graph (DAG) with `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1`, the task is to find all possible paths from node `0` to node `n - 1` and return them in any order.

The graph is represented as follows:
- `graph[i]` is a list of all nodes you can visit from node `i` (i.e., there is a directed edge from node `i` to `graph[i][j]`).

### Example 1

**Input:**
```python
graph = [[1,2],[3],[3],[]]
```

**Output:**
```python
[[0,1,3],[0,2,3]]
```

**Explanation:**
There are two paths: `0 -> 1 -> 3` and `0 -> 2 -> 3`.

### Example 2

**Input:**
```python
graph = [[4,3,1],[3,2,4],[3],[4],[]]
```

**Output:**
```python
[[0,4],[0,3,4],[0,1,3,4],[0,1,2,3,4],[0,1,4]]
```

### Constraints
- `n == graph.length`
- `2 <= n <= 15`
- `0 <= graph[i][j] < n`
- `graph[i][j] != i` (i.e., there will be no self-loops).
- All the elements of `graph[i]` are unique.
- The input graph is guaranteed to be a DAG.

## Solution: 

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

class Solution {
    private List<List<Integer>> ans = new ArrayList<>();

    public void dfs(int[][] graph, int curr, List<Integer> currList, int target) {
        // Add the current node to the path
        currList.add(curr);

        // If we reach the target node, add the current path to the answer list
        if (curr == target) {
            ans.add(new ArrayList<>(currList)); // Add a copy of the current path
        } else {
            // Explore all adjacent nodes
            for (int next : graph[curr]) {
                dfs(graph, next, currList, target);
            }
        }

        // Backtrack: remove the last node from the current path
        currList.remove(currList.size() - 1);
    }

    public List<List<Integer>> allPathsSourceTarget(int[][] graph) {
        List<Integer> currList = new ArrayList<>();

        // Start DFS from the source node (0) to the target node (graph.length - 1)
        dfs(graph, 0, currList, graph.length - 1);

        return ans;
    }
}
```
