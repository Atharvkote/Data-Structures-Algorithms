# 200. Number Of Islands


Given an `m x n` 2D binary grid grid which represents a map of `'1's (land)` and `'0's (water)`, return the number of islands.

An `island` is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands `horizontally` or `vertically`. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

 

### Example 1:

```
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
```
### Output: 1

### Example 2:

```
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
```


### Output: 3
 

## Constraints:

`m == grid.length`<br>
`n == grid[i].length`<br>
`1 <= m, n <= 300`<br>
`grid[i][j] is '0' or '1'.`

## Solution 

```java
class Solution {
    public int numIslands(char[][] grid) {
        int numberOfIslands = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < grid.length; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < grid[i].length; j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] == '1') {
                    numberOfIslands++;
                    dfs(i, j, grid);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return numberOfIslands;
    }
    
    void dfs(int i, int j, char[][] grid) {
        if (i < 0 || i >= grid.length || j < 0 || j >= grid[i].length || grid[i][j] == '0') {
            return;
        }
        
        grid[i][j] = '0';
        dfs(i, j + 1, grid);
        dfs(i + 1, j, grid);
        dfs(i, j - 1, grid);
        dfs(i - 1, j, grid);
    }
}
